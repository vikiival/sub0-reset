## Multisend?

My friend Viki has a problem, he wants to send all his ERC-20s and NFTs from an old wallet into the new wallet.

He has two types of wallet
- one created with metamask
- one is an smart contract wallet (argent)

**Q how would you help him?**

## Chain of thought

What I need to do? 

As an EVM developer I have basically a few options

**1. Write a script**

I can write a script that will send all the tokens from one wallet to another. 

Pros: 
+ He will know what is going to happen

Cons:
- Many transaction signatures
- Lot of gas consumed

**2. Write a smart contract**

Basically I can write the same thing as a smart contract.
However, batch can be done in a single transaction.

Pros:
+ Less gas consumed
+ Just one transaction

Cons:
- I need to deploy SC
- Still need to do approval or sign permits

**3. Multicall/Multisend**

Does what would Viki need.

Pros:
+ Just one transaction
+ Exacly what Viki needs

Cons:
- Not all wallets support it
- Transaction builder only available for Safe wallet
- have you seen the code? ðŸ˜­

**4. Just EIP-5792 bro**

Ethereum has new EIP-5792 that allows you to do batch calls. Perfect use case for this.

Pros:
+ All you need in one transaction
+ Easy to compose a transaction list via `wagmi`

Const:
- Needs to be supported both by wallet and chain/RPC provider
- Limited amount of wallets

## How so do you have a multicall on this Polkadot thing?

Yes. - 3 types

- batch 
- batch_all
- force_batch


Can I use the batch calls in Solidity? 
[Yes, on moonbeam](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/batch/#find-a-contract-interactions-call-data)
