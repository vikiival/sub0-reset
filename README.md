# Small activities for Sub0 Reset by @vikiival

This is a collection of workshops for the sub0

The goal:
> "I think you could really come up with fun things people can hack on" - Sacha

## Challenges

As you may observe there are multiple challenges you can hack on; starting from simple to more advanced

### First steps

1. Fork & clone the repo

2. Initialize Polkadot API

```bash
npx papi
```

3. Generate your private key

```bash
pnpm generate
```

4. Play with challenges

5. [Submit via this form](https://voedlx91m5k.typeform.com/to/reN3rKZo) ðŸ‘ˆ


Never played with Polkadot before? Good opportunity to try read/write:
  - Multicall
  - Standards

### Warm up

- Proxies
- Pallets and Contracts

### Pump it up

- ERC-721ink!

## Dev

Each activity contains a challenge file with a set of task that needs to be done (implemented).

1. Install dependencies

> [!NOTE]
> Node v20+ and pnpm v9.6+ are recommended for this project. But `Bun` works too <3 

```bash
pnpm i
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Probably you would need to use `npx papi` to setup the Polkadot API

To run the challenge:

```bash
pnpm name_of_the_challenge
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have created a `.env` file with your private key
> if you do not have one run

```bash
pnpm generate
```
